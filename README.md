Clustering On Map With Custom Marker

By clustering your markers, you can put a large number of markers on a map without making the map hard to read.

The marker clustering utility helps you manage multiple markers at different zoom levels. To be precise, the 'markers' are actually 'items' at this point, and only become 'Markers' when they're rendered. But for the sake of clarity, this document will name them 'markers' throughout.

When a user views the map at a high zoom level, the individual markers show on the map. When the user zooms out, the markers gather together into clusters, to make viewing the map easier.
