    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    4E:62:48:FD:29:23:AC:79:61:AB:1E:49:4D:D5:2B:83:C5:FF:0D:3D

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
